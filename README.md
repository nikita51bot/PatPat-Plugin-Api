# PatPat Plugin API

----------------------------------

A public API for the PatPat Plugin, designed for use in third‑party plugins (Bukkit, Spigot, Paper, etc.) to interact with PatPat’s features.

## Features

Currently, the API provides a limited but useful set of functionality. At the moment, you can:

- Trigger the pat action on any LivingEntity, with the ability to specify which player initiated the pat.
- Listen for player packet events and optionally cancel their propagation, which is useful for implementing custom restriction or permission systems.
